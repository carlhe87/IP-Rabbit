I have used the Index of Visser's book as a starting point. These days I have been working on the index of Visser's book.
I extracted the main entries of the index to form a keyword list. And use this list for later projects.

Two tools could be used: **NotePad++** user defined language, for text editing; or **Pearl** extenion in Chrome for web browsing.
The second tool is better since it also include "partial" match, while the UDL of NotePad++ have no such function, one can only manually label all keywords, by search - mark function. Which is mono-color and not automatic for long keyword list.

Although Notepad++ is not good enough for reading, the replacement function therein is really powerful, I have used it to arrange the keyword list and adjust it for different applications. 

The current *Index* can be used directly for reading Visser's book, reading any other text, for Freymann method study.
The *keyword list* can be used for manual highlight guide, Chrome auto multi highlight, and NotePad++ writing
The current *Index* can be further expanded into a mindmap or conccept map or even a knowledge graph.

I have uitilized the NotePad++ and Pearl for cleaning the text of EPC and IR, now available in this website.
EPC and IR are legal texts and therefore no copyright issue exists. It is safe to publish.  
In the next step, I would like to edit the EPC and IR in a wiki manner with keywords and index based on Visser's book.
Since I am working based on the book, rather than copying it, therefore, there should be no copy right issue.  
The wiki style can be combined with highlighting: link keywords to the index, and then free highlight. This can be a gradual process during the study of the index.
