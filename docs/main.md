# Visser's Book, index of
2020.06.13  
I have used the Index of Visser's book as a starting point. These days I have been working on the index of Visser's book.
I extracted the main entries of the index to form a keyword list. And use this list for later projects.

Two tools could be used: **NotePad++** user defined language, for text editing; or **Pearl** extenion in Chrome for web browsing.
The second tool is better since it also include "partial" match, while the UDL of NotePad++ have no such function, one can only manually label all keywords, by search - mark function. Which is mono-color and not automatic for long keyword list.

Although Notepad++ is not good enough for reading, the replacement function therein is really powerful, I have used it to arrange the keyword list and adjust it for different applications. 

The current *Index* can be used directly for reading Visser's book, reading any other text, for Freymann method study.
The *keyword list* can be used for manual highlight guide, Chrome auto multi highlight, and NotePad++ writing
The current *Index* can be further expanded into a mindmap or conccept map or even a knowledge graph.

I have uitilized the NotePad++ and Pearl for cleaning the text of EPC and IR, now available in this website.
EPC and IR are legal texts and therefore no copyright issue exists. It is safe to publish.  
In the next step, I would like to edit the EPC and IR in a wiki manner with keywords and index based on Visser's book.
Since I am working based on the book, rather than copying it, therefore, there should be no copy right issue.  
The wiki style can be combined with highlighting: link keywords to the index, and then free highlight. This can be a gradual process during the study of the index.  

# Inventive step, problem-solution approach
## relationship between problem, difference, and effect
The "problem" is a "task" or a gap to be overcome by person skilled in the art(PSA) to work out a solution to reach the present invention(PI) from the closest prior art(CPA).  
The "solution" bridges the said gap.  The prior art provides a "solution PA" and the PI provides a "solution PI". "solution PA" + "solution" = "solution PI"
Difference refers to difference in technical features. It is the **presence** of the said difference rather than the difference in itself that result in the technical effect. In analogy, if someone eat seven loafs bread and feel full, it is not the seventh loaf, but the seventh loaf in addition to the previous six altogether, that cause the feeling of fullness. Here, "partial problem" is an issue. If the seventh bread is exceptionally large and so large that without the previous six loaves one still reach fullness. Then the distinguishing feature in itself can solve the problem, so that the obviousness analysis is altered. 

# Novelty
Since novelty issue is a matter of existance, regardless how remote the document can be, anything published here, for example, should also be counted as SOA. Is that right?
