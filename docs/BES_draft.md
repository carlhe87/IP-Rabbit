# Problems met
## Summary of invention: to what extent?
Are all features in SOA included, i.e. similar to the preamble in the two-part form? But that could be too long.
*provisional measure*: arbitural cut-off, just sufficient to differntiate from other indipendent claims.

## Embodiments: preferred or not?
It is known that preferred embodiment or alternative embodiments are different. But what are the consequences?
Situations in the two-list principle?
*provisional measure*: dependent claims as preferred embodiment, the rest as alternatives.
